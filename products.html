                                   product provides a broad array of security enhancements including the ability to
                                   identify “who” has rights to resources across the entire organization. It also
                                   provides the ability to grant, revoke, clone, modify and overwrite permissions
                                   quickly and from a central location. Unlike native tools, Permission Manager provides
                                   the ability to back up and restore permissions only, ensuring the integrity of data.
                                   To help meet auditing requirements, Permission Manager provides convenient reports
                                   that can be pulled on the fly. Last, the product’s cleanup capabilities address
                                   common post-migration security issues.
